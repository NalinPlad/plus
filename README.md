### Docs 📖

Ill add some basic documentation of some of plus's functionality here. Most people wont even need to read this to user plus, it is very straight forward!

#### Basic operations

plus's syntax is very similar to anything you would enter into a normal calculator(apart from a few special cases), so equtions like
```
plus> 5+5
10
plus> 13*3
39
plus> (16/4)^3
64
```

all work as intended. Note here that the parser will ignore whitespace, so you could also type `plus> ( 16  /4) ^  3`

#### Variables

Define variables with `=`

```
plus> x = 32
32
plus> y = 45/9
5
plus> z = x / y
6.4
```

then use it like this

```
plus> 3y / 2
7.5
plus> 5 * z
32
plus> 5(z)
32
plus> 5z
32
```

multiplication syntax is pretty robust, as seen in the last 3 lines

#### Trig functions

plus (currently) includes 6 trig functions, sin(), cos(), tan(), and csc(), sec(), cot(). 
> note the constant `pi`

```
plus> sin(2pi)
0
plus> cos(32)
0.8342233605
plus> tan(180)
1.3386902104
plus> pi
3.1415926536
```

#### Roots

plus has a couple roots functions for calculating square and cube roots. Arbitrary roots are planned(See [TODO](https://github.com/NalinPlad/plus/blob/master/TODO)) Both `√` and `sqrt()` can be used

```
plus> √25
5
plus> sqrt(100)
10
plus> (3)√125
5
plus> cbrt(1000)
10
```

#### Logarithms

calculate logarithms using the `log()` keyword. There are also functions for natural logs `ln()`. Calculate arbitrary logs using `log x ()`
> note the predefined `e` constant

```
plus> log(100)
2
plus> ln(e)
1
plus> log 5 (25)
2
```

#### Ans

use `ans` to access the output of the last command

```
plus> 108 * 34
3672
plus> ans / 2
1836
plus> ans-1800
36
plus> ans / 6
6
```
